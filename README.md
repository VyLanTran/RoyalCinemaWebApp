# Royal Cinema Web App

This is a website where you can see all the movies that are currently playing at Royal Cinema and get a ticket easily.

## Important features of the app
- The website interface is nicely designed and responsive for all screen sizes 
- There is a hero on top of the home page showing new movies. The hero is also a swiper that automatically changes its view every 2 seconds.
- Clicking the poster of a movie will navigate users to the movie details page. 
- One the details page, users can read the movie's overview, select a date and showing time that fit their schedule. 
- Next, the auditorium map will be shown, you can reserve as many seats as you want.
- After that, you can choose the type of tickets (adult, child, or senior) and the quantity for each type.
- Hit the "Checkout" button when you're done. A confirmation page will be shown accordingly.
- I also used Google Firebase in this project to control database user. Use email and password to log into your account.
