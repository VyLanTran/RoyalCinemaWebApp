# Royal Cinema Web App

This is a website where you can see all the movies that are currently playing at Royal Cinema and get a ticket easily.

## Important features of the app
- The website interface is nicely designed and responsive for all screen sizes 
- There is a hero on top of the home pag showing new movies. The hero is also a swiper that automatically changes its view.
- Clicking the poster of a movie will navigate users to the movie details page. 
- One the details page, users can read the movie's overview, select a date and showing time that fit their schedule. 
- There is a page showing the auditorium map, where users can reserve as many seats as they want. Seats are marked with different colors and symbols to imform users if a seat is already taken or if it is an accessible seat.
- When users are done choosing their favorite spots, they will see another page to select the type of tickets (adult, child, or senior) and the quantity of each type. Users can only proceed the payment after they select the correct number of tickets (i.e. the quantity matches how many seats they chose in the previous step).
- Hit the "Checkout" button when you're done. A confirmation page will be shown accordingly.
- I also used Google Firebase in this project to control database user. There are options to Sign in/ Sign up on the top right corner of the page. Users can sign up for a new account using their email. Logging in is only successful if you provide the correct password.
